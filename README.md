# Introduction to R for Psychoacoustics

This repository contains the data and the presentation from the workshop "Introduction to R for Psychoacoustics".

This short workshop aims to give an overview on my procedure to visualize and analyze perceptual data that was collected in MATLAB but is analyzed in R. It is a code-along but you do not need to be experienced with R, MATLAB or statistics to participate. However, this workshop does not aim to present the background or fundamentals of MATLAB, R, Tidyverse, or statistics. There is much better material out there than this.
